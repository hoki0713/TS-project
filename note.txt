What Is TypeScript?
- A JavaScript Superset
- A Language building up on JavaScript
- Adds new Features + Advantages to JavaScript
- But browser can't execute TypeScript
- TypeScript will be compiled to JavaScript

Why TypeScript?

in JavaScript

function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(add('2','3'));

Unwanted Behavior at Runtime...

TypeScript is a 'Tool' that helps developers write better code.
